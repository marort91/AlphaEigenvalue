Goals from Last Week: 1) Finish writing SIAM paper.

Goals for Next Week: 1) Edit SIAM paper (edits from Livermore included). Will require substantial revision in my opinion.

12/1/2017

Goals from Last Week: 1) Continue writing SIAM paper
                      2) Study for Plasma Physics Oral Exam
                      
Goals for Next Week: 1) Finish SIAM paper (edits from Livermore incoming).

11/17/2017

Goals from Last Week: 1) Continue writing SIAM paper (Completed)
                      2) Investigate some results from paper (Completed)
                      3) Group presentation (Completed)
                      
Goals for Next Week: 1) Finish rough draft of SIAM paper (almost there)
                     2) Rest
                      
1/25/2016-1/29-2016: Created GitHub repo. Initial reading of literature. Creation of Python Notebooks for two papers.

2/1/2016-2/5/2016: Discovered iPython notebook equation rendering problem on GitHub. Reverted to PDF summaries of papers placed in LiteratureReview folder. Wrote one-speed neutron diffusion equation that solves for k-effective. Alpha-eig algorithms to be implemented along with linear solvers. Currently using \ operator in MATLAB.

2/8/2016-2/12/2016: Created iPython notebooks for both criticality and alpha-eigenvalue methods. Alpha-eigenvalue works though subject to limitations (terrible guesses and sufficiently subcritical systems break it...) Not unexpected result. To implement deflation method to calculate criticality eigenvalue spectrum. Next step is probably two speed data and figuring out how to scatter neutrons...

2/22/2016: Implemented two-group NDE solver. Validated and verified using two-group analytical solution. Seems to work for more energy groups. Currently no upscatter. Hill's algorithm implemented for alpha-eigenvalue calculation. Python notebook to be finished. Need to reexamine array indexing methods. Reviewed Larsen papers on eigenvalues. Feel comfortable with theorems presented.

3/7/2016-3/11/2016: Created research questions and resources planning document. Continued reviewing paper and creating Zotero library. Implemented six-group Hansen-Roach MATLAB script for criticality eigenvalue. LLNL paperwork and reference letters submitted. 

7/6/2017: Added cell-centered neutron transport eigenvalue MATLAB solver. Solves 1D slab multigroup problems. Requires cross section data.
