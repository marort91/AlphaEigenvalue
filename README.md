# Alpha Eigenvalue Project at UC Berkeley

Log File:

1/25/2016-1/29-2016: Created GitHub repo. Initial reading of literature. Creation of Python Notebooks for two papers.

2/1/2016-2/5/2016: Discovered iPython notebook equation rendering problem on GitHub. Reverted to PDF summaries of papers placed in LiteratureReview folder. Wrote one-speed neutron diffusion equation that solves for k-effective. Alpha-eig algorithms to be implemented along with linear solvers. Currently using \ operator in MATLAB.

2/8/2016-2/12/2016: Created iPython notebooks for both criticality and alpha-eigenvalue methods. Alpha-eigenvalue works though subject to limitations (terrible guesses and sufficiently subcritical systems break it...) Not unexpected result. To implement deflation method to calculate criticality eigenvalue spectrum. Next step is probably two speed data and figuring out how to scatter neutrons...
